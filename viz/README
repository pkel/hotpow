1. Run viz.R from the terminal or RStudio. This will produce some files
   containing tikz code.
2. Compile standalone.tex . It will include the previously generated tikz code
   in a PDF plot representing the graph used in viz.R
3. Compile beamer.tex . It will produce example slides where edge properties
   are shown on selected slides only.
