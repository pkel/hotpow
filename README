Outdated
--------

This README is outdated. You're looking at a WIP branch that does not yet
support batched simulation. Instead, we run the simulation on graphml network
topologies.

HotPoW Simulation
-----------------

The simulation framework used for evaluating the HotPoW protocol proposal.

Reproducing the results
-----------------------

We attempt to make reproduction as simple as possible by providing a Dockerfile
for building a statically linked executable from the simulation code. This
encapsulates the OCaml build environment and makes the container runtime the
only non-standard dependency.

We use podman [0] as container runtime, and GNU parallel [1] for running the
simulation in parallel on multiple devices. We use bash and make to glue
everything together. On a system with these dependencies installed, you should
be able to run

./sim.sh

and thereby reproduce the results presented in the evaluation section of our
paper submission.

Podman is a drop in replacement for docker. Our glue code contains logic for
falling back to docker, but unfortunately we were not able to test this
fallback in time for the submission.


Own parameters
--------------

If the compilation of the static executable within the container succeeded, you
will find the simulation program in the _build folder. You can best explore its
capabilities by running

_build/static/sim.exe --help


Going deeper
------------

You will need OCaml, the OCaml package manager opam and the OCaml build tool
dune [2]. If these tools are available,

make sim

will point you towards missing dependencies, build the simulation, and run it
with default parameters. At this stage, modifying the protocol should be
feasible.

We recommend reading the code in the following order:

hotpow.ml
  The HotPoW protocol

common.ml
  Shared code that might also be used by the attacker

sim.ml
  Simulation as compiled to sim.exe


Attacker
--------

The attacker strategies are stored as patches relative to hotpow.ml. You can
generate the attacker implementations by executing

./patch.sh

. Afterwards you can modify the attack strategies. The build process considers
changes made to the generated hotpow_*.ml files. The patch files can be updated
using

./patch.sh update

. Happy Hacking!
